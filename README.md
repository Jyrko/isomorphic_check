# isomorphic_check
There is an example of two algorithms to figure out whether graphs are isomorphic or not, namely the bruteforce method and the Weisfeiler-Lehman test.

Requirements:
  min C++ version - 17
  
To run the program, enter the src directory and enter
  ```g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o main && ./main```
  
There is a possible optimization for the brute force method. Pass true to the bruteforce() method in main.cpp
